    %li What parks and trails are near my home?
    %li How do I get there?

    %li What if I don’t have a car... can I still go outdoors?
  %p Transit and Trails connects you to parks and open spaces by helping you Find, Plan and Share your outdoor adventures. You can locate trailheads near you (or any location) and we help you get there on public transportation or get the directions you need to walk, bike, or drive there. You might try one of the many existing trips on the site or make a new one. You can then share your plans with a link for an email, an Evite or post the trip to Facebook and Twitter. After your hike, share pictures and your experience on Transit and Trails and join the community of people who care about and love exploring parks, trails and open spaces.
  %p
    Transit and Trails was incubated within the
    = succeed "," do
      %a{:href => "http://openspacecouncil.org", :target => "_blank"} Bay Area Open Space Council
    a coalition that collaborates with land trusts, public agencies and conservation organizations to set and execute a conservation vision for the San Francisco Bay Area. Since 1990, the Council has been working regionally to protect the land, connect people to land, and convene efforts to steward parks, trails, and agricultural lands. The Council believes in projects like Transit & Trails that bring nature within reach of all Bay Area residents.

    Transit and Trails is also available for the iPhone. Changes in plans or weather are now no big deal – your trip and transportation information can be in your hands and available within a few clicks.
